##Exercise 3 - Printing Quotes

Quotation marks are often used to denote the start and end of a string.  But sometimes we need to print out the quotation marks themselves by using *escape characters*.

Create a program that prompts for a quote and an author.  Display the quotation and the author as shown in the example output.

###Example Output

What is the quote? These aren't the droids you're looking for.
Who said it? Obi-Wan Kenobi
Obi-Wan Kenobi says, "These aren't the droids you're looking for."
